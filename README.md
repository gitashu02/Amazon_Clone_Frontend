# Amazon_Clone
This project is a simple replica of the Amazon website's front page, made using just HTML and CSS. It includes key sections like the header with a search bar, navigation menu, product categories, and a footer, all designed to look like the real Amazon homepage. The layout is responsive, meaning it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Features are:-
-Header: Includes Amazon logo, location selection, search bar, language selector, sign-in, returns, and cart options.
-Navigation Panel: Quick links like "Today's Deals" and "Sell".
-Hero Section: A promotional message with a link to Amazon India.
-Product Categories: Display of product categories (e.g., Clothes, Health, Furniture) with images and "See More" links.
-Footer: Links to Amazon services, payment options, and account help, plus a logo and copyright info.
